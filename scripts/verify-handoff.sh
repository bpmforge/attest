# verify-handoff.sh — mechanical verify-loop evidence harness (v2.44.0)
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS: small models cannot reliably self-report verify compliance.
# Field traces (2026-07, gpt-5-mini): `|| true` appended to gates, biome errors
# relabeled "non-blocking suggestions", output head-truncated past the summary
# line (`| sed -n '1,240p'` cut off "Found 57 errors"), integration commands
# never run ("covered by the suite"), pass counts below baseline shipped anyway.
# Every one of those was a prose rule the model broke. This script makes them
# mechanical: it runs each command EXACTLY as written, captures full output,
# keeps the TAIL, extracts pass counts, compares against a stored baseline, and
# writes the report itself. The model's job shrinks to: run this, read the one
# verdict line, fix, re-run.
#
# Usage:
#   bash verify-handoff.sh <file>              # run commands from the file's ```verify fence
#   bash verify-handoff.sh <file> --baseline   # also store the baseline (run BEFORE editing)
#   bash verify-handoff.sh -c "cmd" [-c ...]   # explicit commands, no file
#   Options: --report <path>   (default docs/work/VERIFY_REPORT.md)
#
# The ```verify fence: first fenced block opening with ```verify in the file;
# each non-empty, non-# line is one command, run verbatim via `bash -c` from
# the directory this script was invoked in.
#
# Three wrong-verdict channels this closes (field trace 2026-07, downstream project):
#   * A command that matched NOTHING is not a pass. `jest --passWithNoTests`,
#     vitest with no match, and `eslint --no-error-on-unmatched-pattern` all exit
#     0 having tested nothing; `biome check <config-excluded-path>` exits non-zero
#     with "No files were processed" and reads as the agent's defect. Both are the
#     same bug — a fence/path/config defect — and both are now named as one.
#     Guarded by a zero-pass-count precondition, so a monorepo run where one
#     package has no tests but 1000 pass elsewhere is NOT flagged.
#   * A summed pass-count cannot tell a pre-existing failure from a new one. The
#     baseline now stores failing-test SIGNATURES plus provenance (commit,
#     branch, command count). On RED, the current failing set is compared against
#     it: a subset means BASELINE_RED (pre-existing, not this agent's work); any
#     new signature stays RED and only the NEW ones are named. Attribution is
#     claimed only when the baseline commit is an ancestor of HEAD — otherwise
#     the verdict says UNKNOWN rather than guessing.
#   * A run with no baseline silently performs no regression check at all. The
#     ALL GREEN verdict now says so, so absent evidence stops reading as evidence.
#
# Baseline format (docs/work/verify-baseline.txt): line 1 is the summed
# pass-count — a bare integer file from any earlier version still reads
# correctly — followed by `# `-prefixed provenance and `# fail:` signatures.
#
# Exit: 0 = ALL GREEN, 1 = RED, 2 = usage/no commands, 3 = BASELINE_RED
# (every failure pre-dates this work; the verdict line is the authority and
# handoff-done.sh treats it as a warning, not a block).
#
# Known gaps, stated rather than hidden: a pass-count that RISES while tests are
# deleted (+10 new / -5 removed) is still undetectable — that needs a full
# test-name inventory, not just failures. And the pass-count sum greps the whole
# log, so a test NAME containing "5 passed" inflates it.
#
# Never-sudo, dependency-free (bash 3.2+, awk, tail, grep). Never masks an
# exit code; never truncates the head of a summary.
