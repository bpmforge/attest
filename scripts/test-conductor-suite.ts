/**
 * test-conductor-suite.ts — Pass 53 chapter module for scripts/test.ts.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. `scripts/conductor/conductor.test.mjs` and
 * `resume.test.mjs` were written as standalone `node --test` files and never
 * wired into the Pass-N suite — originally because they fell outside the
 * authoring ticket's `scripts/conductor/**` write scope. The consequence was
 * not theoretical: v3.1.0 and v3.1.1 both shipped with ALL FOUR conductor
 * tests failing while `npm test` reported a clean 607, because nothing in the
 * suite ran them. The conductor's own E2E test had in fact been failing
 * identically since v2.30.0. A test that no harness executes is not a test;
 * it is a file that resembles one.
 *
 * So this Pass runs them as a subprocess and reports their TAP result. It
 * deliberately shells out to `node --test` rather than re-implementing the
 * fixtures here: those tests build real git repos, real worktrees and real
 * merges, and duplicating that setup is exactly the kind of second copy that
 * drifts from the original and then lies about it.
 *
 * Runtime is ~40s — real git, real worktrees and real validators, not stubs.

/**
 * DISCOVERED, NOT LISTED.
 *
 * This Pass began as a hardcoded list of two files, and the list is how the
 * problem recurs: on 2026-09-08 a sweep found SIX more `*.test.mjs` suites
 * that no harness had ever run — the entire JIRA board driver's unit, parity
 * and integration tests (jira-tickets*.test.mjs, 11 tests over a 342-line
 * driver), plus annotate, img-gate and log-hop. All six were green when found,
 * so nothing was broken; they were simply unprotected, which is the state
 * conductor.test.mjs was in while it stayed RED across three releases.
 *
 * A list has to be updated by whoever adds a suite, and the failure is silent
 * when they don't. Discovery cannot be forgotten: any `*.test.mjs` added
 * anywhere under scripts/ is run from the moment it exists.
