/**
 * test-autopilot.ts — chapter module for scripts/test.ts.
 *
 * Guards the /autopilot skill (feat/autopilot, 2026-08-31): the orchestrator
 * entry point that lets opencode assess what's left, decide the path forward,
 * drive the EXISTING loops (conductor / run-until-done / run-plan) to
 * completion, and heal or park stuck units. The skill is doctrine-as-prose,
 * so this pins three independent things:
 *
 *   1. skills/autopilot/SKILL.md exists with valid frontmatter and carries
 *      its load-bearing content — the five contract stages (ASSESS / DECIDE /
 *      DRIVE / HEAL / EXIT), the story-denominated assessment ("a drained
 *      board proves nothing"), done-is-a-predicate, the heal ladder in order
 *      (narrowed retry → split → tier escalation → park with evidence), the
 *      JIRA-authoritative board assessment, byte-identical no-progress HALT,
 *      the mandatory iteration cap using
 *      existing tier ceilings (6 metered / 12 local), and that it DRIVES the
 *      existing machinery by path instead of inventing new loops.
 *   2. It is REGISTERED everywhere its siblings (/goal, /wave) are:
 *      docs/FEATURES.md skill table, README.md routing table, and
 *      build-target-claude.mjs's KNOWN_MISSING_IN_CLAUDE (skills/ is
 *      per-target hand-maintained; the attest-claude port is the tracked
 *      follow-up, same pattern as wave/goal — test-skills-parity.ts asserts
 *      that set matches the live pair exactly).
 *   3. Self-test (planted RED): the phrase checks are not tautological — a
 *      gutted copy of the skill (HEAL ladder + halt rule stripped) must fail
 *      at least the checks that guard it.
