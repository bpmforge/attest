## Context Budget (MANDATORY for local models)

Before loading multiple large files or running multi-step tool loops, read `~/.config/opencode/agents/shared/CONTEXT_BUDGET.md`. Check `MODEL_ADAPTER.md` for your model tier.

- **32k context (small/local):** max 4 source files in context at once; write checkpoint before reading more
- **60k context (medium):** max 8 files; check budget at each phase boundary
- **100k+ (cloud):** standard operation; write to disk after every major output block

If context exceeds 80%: write what you have to disk and continue from the checkpoint. Never silently drop content — write first.
