# 5.2 SDLC Orchestrator

The orchestrator is split across five files loaded on demand: `sdlc-lead.md` (spine) + one mode file per session.

## sdlc-lead — Startup and Gate Loop

Every session starts with state detection and mode routing. Every HANDOFF return passes a 3-gate scoring loop before advancing.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant LEAD as sdlc-lead
    participant SH as detect-sdlc-state.sh
    participant MODE as Mode File
    participant SPEC as Specialist Agent
    participant GATE as run-handoff-gates.sh

    U->>LEAD: slash command or natural language
    LEAD->>SH: detect-sdlc-state.sh
    SH-->>LEAD: fresh, partial, brownfield, or complete
    LEAD->>LEAD: Read sdlc-state.md if prior session
    LEAD-->>U: Present state summary and mode options
    U->>LEAD: Confirm mode
    LEAD->>MODE: Read mode file (init, onboard, feature, or improve)
    MODE-->>LEAD: Mode instructions loaded

    loop Per delegation
        LEAD->>LEAD: Write context-for-agent.md
        LEAD->>SPEC: HANDOFF block (task + context + produce)
        SPEC-->>LEAD: Completion Manifest + phrase
        LEAD->>GATE: run-handoff-gates.sh
        GATE-->>LEAD: scope gate + manifest gate + coverage gate
        alt score >= 7
            LEAD->>LEAD: Append DONE to DELEGATION_LOG.md
            LEAD-->>U: Phase complete, confirm next?
        else score 5-6
            LEAD->>SPEC: HANDOFF REVISE (max 3x)
        else score < 5
            LEAD-->>U: Auto-fail with gap explanation
        end
    end
```

**Human approval gates:**
- **Gate A** (Phase 2 → 3): blocks before any design docs are written
- **Gate B** (Phase 3.5 → 4): blocks before any coding HANDOFFs are emitted
