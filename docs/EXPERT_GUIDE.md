# Expert Guide — How Each Agent Works

This document explains each expert agent's methodology, when to use them, and what they produce.

It covers the slash-command experts. Every other agent — verification (challenger, gauntlet, ui-verifier, qa-vnv), the design loop, the end-user guide pipeline, docs/release helpers and the game cluster — has a one-paragraph entry in [AGENT_REFERENCE.md](AGENT_REFERENCE.md). For how the experts chain together, see the diagrams in [flows/](flows/README.md).

## Guide — Concierge (`/guide`)

The front door. Describe any goal in plain English and `guide` routes it to the
right expert, explains the route, checks prerequisites (via `doctor.sh`), drives
the workflow, and always offers the next step — especially "want me to fix what
I found?".

- **Routes everything:** SDLC, security (find + fix), code health, dead code, performance, database, UX, tests, releases, research, game dev.
- **Guided security flow:** scope → scan (`/security`) → triage → fix (`/security --fix`).
- **Multi-step goals:** sequences experts (e.g. "harden before launch" → security → review-code → perf → fix → tests).
- **Big/unfamiliar work:** routes to `task-decomposer` → `scripts/run-plan.mjs` so it stays reliable on small models.

It never produces deliverables itself — it gets you to the expert that does.

## SDLC Lead (`/sdlc`)

**Role:** Program manager and lead architect. Orchestrates the full software development lifecycle.

**When to use:**
- Starting a new project from scratch
- Understanding an existing codebase you've never seen
- Adding a feature to a running system

**How it thinks:**
- What mode are we in? (New project, existing codebase, feature addition)
- Which expert does this need? (Delegates, never does technical work itself)
- What engineering artifacts exist? What's missing?
- Is the architecture modular?

**Four modes** (split into their own files — spine at `agents/sdlc-lead.md`, modes at `agents/sdlc-<mode>-mode.md`):
1. **`/sdlc init`** — New project: Ideation → Planning → Requirements → *Gate A* → Design → Test Design (3.5) → *Gate B* → Implementation → Review + Release
2. **`/sdlc onboard [--quick | --deep]`** — Reverse-engineer codebase through four onboard specialists + a health-assessment fan-out. The default adds a ROUTE/TABLE inventory check; `--deep` runs the full Ralph Wiggum inventory loop (`agents/shared/RALPH_WIGGUM_LOOP.md`).
3. **`/sdlc feature`** — Impact analysis (app-cartographer) → atomic/split → Design → test-first Implement + review + fix-verify → Verify → Document + runtime gate → merge
4. **`/sdlc improve ["<scope>"]`** — Audit, synthesize findings into ranked backlog, execute chosen items. Routes Size-L items into Mode 3 sub-workflows.

**Plus two utility commands:** `/sdlc gate` (SDLC-aware gate check, auto-detects phase from `docs/work/sdlc-state.md`) and `/sdlc status` (phase progress overview without running validators).

**Natural-language router (mandatory):** Phrases like "review for gaps", "audit this", "what could we improve", "make it better", "find problems", "evaluate" are force-routed into Mode 4 — never freelanced as a one-shot review. Single-file/PR/function asks bypass Mode 4 and go to `/review-code` directly.

**Interactive questioning phases (mandatory):**
- **Mode 1 (init):** Runs a 7-question Discovery Interview *before Phase 0* — problem, users, metrics, constraints, integrations, out-of-scope, compliance. Writes `docs/DISCOVERY.md`. Must confirm summary before any document is written.
- **Mode 1 (Phase 3):** Runs a Design Clarification Interview before architecture work — deployment env, scale, performance targets, integrations, team experience. Writes `docs/DESIGN_CONTEXT.md`.
- **Mode 3 (feature):** Runs a Feature Discovery Interview before impact analysis — problem, users, done criteria, constraints, priority, patterns, concerns.

**Two-track gate loop (not one-shot pass/fail):**
- **Coverage loop** (Phases 2–5, onboard, feature, improve): `run-coverage-loop.sh <phase>` runs the deterministic validators, loops on gaps, caps at 3 iterations
- **Confidence loop** (Phases 0–1, prose deliverables): score 1-10 on Completeness + Quality — < 5 automatic fail, 5-6 revise (up to 3 iterations), >= 7 pass

Diagrams for every mode: [flows/](flows/README.md).

**Produces:** VISION.md, SCOPE.md, RISKS.md, SRS.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, and more

**Delegates to:** Every other expert as needed — including coding-agent for implementation work

---

## Coding Agent (`/code`)

**Role:** Senior implementation engineer. Writes production code from SDLC design documents — never from guesswork.

**When to use:**
- Implementing SDLC improvement items (Mode 4 M-sized tasks)
- Building features after design docs exist
- Any implementation task where ARCHITECTURE.md / TECH_STACK.md / IMPROVEMENT_DESIGN.md define the spec

**The Four Laws (enforced before writing any code):**
1. **Read design docs first** — ARCHITECTURE.md, SRS.md, DATABASE.md, API_DESIGN.md, and IMPROVEMENT_*_DESIGN.md are the spec. Nothing gets built that isn't in the spec.
2. **Verify every API via Context7** — calls `resolve-library-id` + `get-library-docs` before using any external library. Never writes from training-data assumptions.
3. **Match existing patterns** — reads 2–3 files in the target directory first, matches structure and naming conventions.
4. **Follow TECH_STACK.md** — all library and framework choices must match what the SDLC architect chose. Flags deviations instead of silently introducing new tech.

**Anti-slop methodology:**
- No try-catch outside system boundaries
- No abstractions with <2 real implementations
- No single-use helper functions
- No what-comments (only why)
- No unused imports, no scope creep

**How it thinks:**
- "Is this the simplest code that correctly implements the spec?"
- "If I can delete a line and it still works, delete it."
- "Does the spec mention this? If not, don't build it."

**6-phase execution:** Read → Verify APIs → Implement → Test → Self-audit → Report

**Produces:** Implementation files + Completion Manifest (files produced, API verifications, tech stack compliance, anti-slop audit result, test result)

**Distinct from:**
- `code-reviewer` — audits code *after* it's written
- `sre-engineer` — CI/CD, monitoring, ops (NOT application code)
- `test-engineer` — test strategy and coverage analysis

---

## Security Auditor (`/security`)

**Role:** Security audit coordinator. Dispatches specialist micro-agents in waves (each in fresh context), synthesizes the report, and drives the verified fix loop.

**When to use:**
- Before shipping to production
- After adding authentication/authorization code
- When handling user input, file uploads, or external data
- Periodic security audits

**How it thinks:**
- What data is most valuable? (credentials, PII, financial)
- Where does user input enter the system?
- What would a breach cost?
- What's the simplest exploit path?

**Methodology:**
1. Read architecture, README and entry points; announce the plan
2. Wave 1 (parallel): semgrep-runner (Opengrep + bpm-rulepacks), secrets-scanner, dependency-auditor
3. Wave 2: owasp-web-checker, + owasp-llm-checker if LLM code
4. Wave 3 (`--deep`): threat-modeler, + cloud/IaC checkers when detected
5. Wave 4 (`--deep`): attack-chainer links findings' yields → preconditions into multi-step exploit chains
6. Synthesize `docs/security/final-report.md`; challenger gate on any HIGH/CRITICAL
7. `--fix`: fix backlog → coding-agent → `fix-verify.mjs` re-scan proves each finding closed

**Produces:** `docs/security/*_FINDINGS_<date>.md` per specialist, `ATTACK_CHAINS_<date>.md` (deep), `final-report.md`, and with `--fix` a `SECURITY_FIX_REPORT_<date>.md`. Diagrams: [flows/security.md](flows/security.md).

**Reference docs used:** `owasp-checklist.md`, `severity-matrix.md`, `report-template.md`

## Researcher (`/research`)

**Role:** Professional research analyst. Evidence-based investigation with citations.

**When to use:**
- Choosing between technologies or frameworks
- Competitive analysis for a new product
- Understanding a domain before designing
- Evaluating feasibility of an approach

**How it thinks:**
- What decision hangs on this research?
- What would change the recommendation?
- Am I confirming a bias or genuinely exploring alternatives?

**Methodology:**
1. Define specific research questions
2. Search primary sources first (official docs, specs)
3. Cross-reference with expert analysis and community data
4. Evaluate source authority and recency
5. Synthesize findings with confidence levels
6. Produce structured report with citations

**Research backbone:** Built-in `webfetch` / `websearch` are disabled in `examples/opencode.json`. The hard fallback chain is `playwright-search_web_research` → `playwright-search_web_fetch` → `pullmd_read_url(render="force")` → STOP and surface `RESEARCH BLOCKED`. Full surface at `agents/shared/RESEARCH_TOOLS.md`.
