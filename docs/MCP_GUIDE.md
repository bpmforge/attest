## Overview — all registered MCPs

| MCP | Purpose | Claude Code | OpenCode |
|-----|---------|-------------|---------|
| `playwright-mcp` | Browser automation, screenshots, E2E testing | ✅ | ✅ |
| `playwright-search` | Multi-engine web research + page extraction | ✅ | ✅ |
| `context7` | Live library API docs lookup | ✅ | ✅ |
| `memory` | Cross-session project memory (decisions, facts, patterns) | ✅ | ✅ |
| `code-search` | Semantic code search + symbol index | ✅ | ✅ |

`install.sh` sets up all of these except `memory`, which is opt-in (`--memory`). Skip others with `--no-playwright-mcp`, `--no-playwright-search` or `--no-code-search`.

There is no separate `pullmd` service any more: it was removed in v2.2.0. The `*_pullmd`-named tools (`web_search_pullmd`, `web_research_pullmd`) are provided by `playwright-search` itself and keep the name only for compatibility. `install.sh` removes a stale `pullmd` entry left by an older install.

## playwright-mcp — Browser automation & screenshots

**What it does:** Gives agents a real browser (Chromium via Playwright). LLM-agnostic — no vision model required; uses the accessibility tree by default, with screenshots on demand. Works identically in Claude Code and OpenCode.

**When to use it:**
- Visual verification of a deployed UI feature
- E2E test recording / verification
- Screenshots for design review or bug reports
- Interacting with web forms, dashboards, and single-page apps

**Install (handled by `install.sh`):**
```bash
# Claude Code — registers once per user
claude mcp add playwright -- npx -y @playwright/mcp@latest

# OpenCode — in opencode.json (auto-written by install.sh)
"playwright-mcp": {
  "type": "local",
  "command": ["npx", "-y", "@playwright/mcp@latest"],
  "enabled": true
}
```

**Manual install without install.sh:**
```bash
# Claude Code
claude mcp add playwright -- npx -y @playwright/mcp@latest

# OpenCode — edit ~/.config/opencode/opencode.json and add the block above
```

**Key tools:**

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `browser_navigate(url)` | Navigate to a URL |
| `browser_screenshot()` | Take a screenshot (returns image) |
| `browser_snapshot()` | Accessibility tree snapshot — for non-vision models |
| `browser_click(element)` | Click a button, link, or any element |
| `browser_type(element, text)` | Type into a focused input |
| `browser_fill(element, value)` | Fill a form field |
| `browser_select_option(element, value)` | Select from a dropdown |
| `browser_get_url()` | Get current URL |
| `browser_wait_for(selector, state)` | Wait for element (visible/hidden/attached) |
| `browser_evaluate(js)` | Run JavaScript in the page |
| `browser_close()` | Close the browser session |

**Typical pattern — UI verification:**
```
browser_navigate("http://localhost:3000/dashboard")
browser_wait_for(".dashboard-loaded", "visible")
browser_screenshot()         ← attach to report
browser_snapshot()           ← check for error states in accessibility tree
```

**Typical pattern — form testing:**
```
browser_navigate("http://localhost:3000/login")
browser_fill("[name=email]", "test@example.com")
browser_fill("[name=password]", "password123")
browser_click("[type=submit]")
browser_wait_for(".dashboard", "visible")
browser_screenshot()
```

**Headless vs headed mode:** By default runs headless. To see the browser:
```bash
PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_HEADED=true claude
```

**vs `playwright-search`:** playwright-search is for web research (multi-engine search + content extraction). playwright-mcp is for browser automation (navigate to your app, click things, take screenshots). Use both for their respective jobs.

## playwright-search — Web research & page extraction

> Powered by **Quarry** (`github.com/bpmforge/quarry`, npm `@bpmforge/quarry`) — the bpmforge web-retrieval product. The MCP server keeps the name `playwright-search` (and the `playwright-search_*` tool names) as a stable alias, so no config changes are needed.

**What it does:** Multi-engine web search (DuckDuckGo + Brave + Bing) with paragraph-ranked extraction and 24h cache. Also extracts clean content from any URL — handles JS-heavy SPAs, Cloudflare pages, and paywalled content via a 4-stage pipeline.

**Install (handled by `install.sh` — clones and builds automatically):**
```bash
# Manual install
git clone https://github.com/bpmforge/quarry.git ~/.local/share/playwright-search
cd ~/.local/share/playwright-search && npm install && npm run build

# Claude Code — register
claude mcp add playwright-search node ~/.local/share/playwright-search/dist/mcp.js

# OpenCode — in opencode.json
"playwright-search": {
  "type": "local",
  "command": ["node", "~/.local/share/playwright-search/dist/mcp.js"],
  "enabled": true
}
```

**Key tools:**

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `playwright-search_web_research(query)` | Multi-engine search with ranked extraction |
| `playwright-search_web_fetch(url)` | Extract clean content from a URL |

**Use in research backbone:**
```
playwright-search_web_research("Playwright MCP server tools list")
playwright-search_web_fetch("https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp")
```

## context7 — Live library API docs

**What it does:** Fetches up-to-date library documentation from the Context7 index. Prevents agents from using stale training-data APIs that may have changed. Used by `coding-agent` before using any external library.

**Install:** Runs via npx — no local clone needed.
```bash
# Claude Code
claude mcp add context7 -- npx -y @upstash/context7-mcp@latest

# OpenCode — in opencode.json
"context7": {
  "type": "local",
  "command": ["npx", "-y", "@upstash/context7-mcp@latest"],
  "enabled": true
}
```

**Usage pattern:**
```
resolve-library-id("react-query")          → /tanstack/query
get-library-docs("/tanstack/query", topic="useQuery")  → live docs
```

Always call `resolve-library-id` first — library names don't map 1:1 to Context7 IDs.

## memory — Cross-session project memory

**What it does:** Persistent memory store backed by SQLite + vector embeddings. Agents store decisions, constraints, patterns, and bug root causes; future sessions restore them. Hybrid search: vector (35%) + BM25 (35%) + link traversal (30%).

**Prerequisite:** Build bpm-memory-mcp first:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bpmforge/bpm-memory-mcp.git ~/Code/bpm-memory-mcp
cd ~/Code/bpm-memory-mcp && npm install && npm run build
```

**Install (handled by `install.sh` step 8):**
```bash
# Claude Code
claude mcp add memory node ~/Code/bpm-memory-mcp/mcp/memory-server/dist/index.js

# OpenCode — in opencode.json
"memory": {
  "type": "local",
  "command": ["node", "~/Code/bpm-memory-mcp/mcp/memory-server/dist/index.js"],
  "enabled": true
}
```

**The 3-call workflow (from `agents/shared/MEMORY_PRIMER.md`):**

| When | Call |
|------|------|
| Session start | `session_restore()` — load prior decisions/patterns |
| Key discovery | `memory_store({ content, type, confidence, citation })` |
| Session end | `session_save({ summary: "..." })` |

**Types:** `decision`, `fact`, `pattern`, `error`, `preference`

**Fallback when unavailable:** Agents write to `docs/work/SESSION_NOTES.md`.

**Embedding provider:** Read from `~/.claude-memory/config.json`, not from environment variables. With no config file the server uses Ollama at `http://localhost:11434` with `nomic-embed-text`; `install.sh` writes a config selecting LM Studio when it finds LM Studio serving an embedding model and no config exists. If the embedder isn't reachable, memories are stored without vectors and recall is keyword-only (BM25) automatically — there is no switch to set. See `SETUP.md` §3.

---

## code-search — Semantic code search + symbol index

**What it does:** Two-layer search over your codebase: (1) semantic chunk search via embeddings + cosine similarity, (2) structural symbol index (functions, classes, interfaces, types, Markdown sections) extracted at index time. Building the index needs a reachable embedder (LM Studio by default; `code_index` refuses without one); once indexed, search degrades to keyword-only if the embedder goes away.

**Source:** `~/Code/bpm-code-search-mcp/`

**Install (auto-registered in Claude Code settings and OpenCode):**
```bash
# Claude Code — in ~/.claude/settings.json PostToolUse hook (auto-reindexes on edit)
# OpenCode — in opencode.json
"code-search": {
  "type": "local",
  "command": ["node", "~/Code/bpm-code-search-mcp/dist/index.js"],
  "enabled": true
}
```

**First-time setup for a project:**
```
code_index()              ← index the current project (uses LM Studio for embeddings)
code_index_status()       ← verify: files, chunks, symbols, provider
```

**The 6 tools:**

| Tool | Use it for |
|------|-----------|
| `code_index(path?, force?)` | Build / refresh the index |
| `code_search("query", top_k?, path_filter?)` | Semantic search — "what does auth?" |
| `code_symbols(kind?, name_filter?, path_filter?)` | Browse by type — "all classes", "functions named *Auth*" |
| `code_outline("file_path")` | Structural outline of one file |
| `code_references("SymbolName")` | Find all usages of a symbol |
| `code_index_status()` | Status check |

**Reindex on edit:** A PostToolUse hook in `~/.claude/settings.json` auto-reindexes any `.ts/.py/.go/.md` file you edit. No manual reindex needed during active coding.

**Symbol extraction covers:** TypeScript/JS, Python, Go, Rust, Java, C#, Ruby, PHP, Swift, Kotlin, Markdown.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| `claude mcp list` shows MCP as "Pending approval" | Run `claude` interactively once to approve |
| playwright-mcp: "browser not found" | Run `npx playwright install chromium` |
| memory: no results, vector search returns 0 | Start the embedder `~/.claude-memory/config.json` names — with no config file, Ollama with `nomic-embed-text` on port 11434 — then `memory_reembed(onlyMissing=true)` |
| code-search: index empty after edit | Check hook is installed: `grep reindex ~/.claude/settings.json` |
| context7: rate limited | context7 is free but rate-limited; wait and retry |

## Checking what's registered

```bash
# Claude Code
claude mcp list

# OpenCode
cat ~/.config/opencode/opencode.json | jq '.mcp | keys'
